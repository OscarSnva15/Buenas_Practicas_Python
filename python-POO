class:  A class is a collection of objects. a class contains the 	
	(blueprints)planos or the prototype from which the objects are being	
	created. -->Prototipo : coches
	
	it is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods.
			
     Some points on Python class:  

    	*Classes are created by keyword class.
   	*Attributes are the variables that belong to a class. 
   	variables:-->caracts_coche1
    	Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) 	
    	operator. ejemplo---> Myclass.Myattribute
example created an class
Python 3
class Dog()  #Demostrate defining a_class  
	pass	
    	
objetcs: The objetc is an entity that has a state and behavior-comportamiento
	 associated with it , it may be any real-world objetc like a mouse,
	 keyboard,chair,table ,pen, etc.
       An object consists of:
	 state: 	  It is represented by the attributes of an object-
	       	  it also reflect the properties of an objects.
	 behavior: it is represented by the methods of an object. It also
		  reflects the response of an object to other objects.
	 identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one
		  object to interact with other objects.
		  
	to understand the state, behavior,and identity let us take the example
	class dog
	The identity can be considered as the name of the dog.
	state or attributes can be considered as the breed,age,or color of the 
	dog.
	The behavior can be considered as to whether the dog is eating or sleeping
	
example created an object
Python 3
obj = Dog()  #this will create an objetc named obj of the class Dog defined  
		above(sobre)

The self
	1.-class methods must have an extra first paramether in the method 
	definition. We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the
	method, Python provides it.
	
	2.-if we have a method that takes no arguments, then we still have to have 
	one argument __the self__
	
	3.-This is similar to this pointer in C++ and this reference in Java
	
The __init__method:
	the__init__method is similar to constructors in C++ and java., It is run as soon an object of a class is instantiated.
	The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.
	Now let us define a class and create some objects using the self and __init__method
